#WEEK 02

Now it's time to show all the work done to code this in HTML✨

First of all, you need to clone this repository on your device. To do that, you have to follow 
this steps:
- In the handing in you will already have the link to the repository, click on it 😎
- You will find a green button with the word "Code" in it
- When you click there, there will be a link to be copied

Have you done everything? Great!

Assuming you have already installed git, now more steps for you:
- Create a folder where you want your repository cloned
- Once you've done it, click with your right button and select "Git bash here"
- Your console will open and there you just have to type "git clone" and paste the link (the one you copied before, remember?)
- When you press enter, it will start copying everything in the repository to your device
- Now you are ready to see all my work and see how it is

#WEEK 03
